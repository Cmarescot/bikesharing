# Bikesharing

## Overview of analysis 
### Purpose:
In this Analysis we were tasked with analyzing NYC Citibike data in order to gather knowledge about the bike business in NYC in order to persuade stakeholders that a similar bike business like Citibike would be able to be successful in Iowa.

## Results 
### Visualizations:

![checkout_times_by_gender](https://github.com/Cmarescot/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/checkout_times_by_gender.png)
"Males" (orange lines ) are using the bikes the most and for longer, followed by "Females" (Blue), followed by "Unknown" (Red).
![checkout_times_for_users](https://github.com/Cmarescot/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/checkout_times_for_users.png)
The graph is a rightly skewed and has a bell shape. As tripduration increases the number of rides (or records) increases with a peek at around hour 5 and then decreases and remains constant. 
![peekhours](https://github.com/Cmarescot/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/peekhours.png)
There is a consitant pattern when it comes to peekhours in this graph. There seems to be peeks in the morning (around 8-9) and in the afternoon (around 4-5). 
![starting_locations](https://github.com/Cmarescot/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/starting_locations.png)
The circles(bike usage) gets smaller the further away from the city the data gets. 
![trips_by_gender](https://github.com/Cmarescot/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/trips_by_gender.png)
Females and Males follow similar patterns when it comes to when they use bikes (Mornings and Afternoons) but the amount of Males verses Females who use bikes differ. Males use bikes more than Females, as can be proven by the deeper colors in the Males graph. 
![trips_by_weekday](https://github.com/Cmarescot/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/trips_by_weekday.png)
There is a very obvious pattern in this graph with more bike usage in the mornings and afternoons during the weekday and with bike usage happening all day during the weekends. Saturday with more usage than Sunday, as can be proven by the deeper colors on Saturday.
![usertrips_by_gender](https://github.com/Cmarescot/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/usertrips_by_gender.png)
There are more subscribers than there are customers. Majority of the customers are Males, followed by Females, followed by Unknowns. 


## Summary
### Summary of Results:
The NYC bikesharing analysis offered us with a lot of insight on the biking business in NYC. For starters Males seem to be the primary customer and bike riders. Bike riding is popular during the weekdays in the morning and in the afternoon. This can easily be linked to the fact that people (mostly males) are riding their bikes to and from work. During the weekends bike usage happens all day with Saturday having the most bike usage. This is also understandble because Saturdauy tends to be a prefered day to do leisure activites such as bike riding. 
### Suggestions 
Two more visualitions that I would think about are ones focusing on weekend usage. Weekend bike usage happen all day, whereas usage during the week happen more at specific time intervals. I would create a visualization like the "starting locations" map, specifically for weekend usage in order to see where most usage is coming from. I would also look to create a viz for trip durations on the weekends to see if usage are higher during the weekend since people have more time to ride.
